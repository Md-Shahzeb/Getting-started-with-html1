Qno2.Explain the purpose of comments in HTML and provide an example of how to use comments in an HTML
documents?
ans:- * The purpose of Comments in HTML are used to provide notes or remarks within the HTML code that are not displayed on the rendered webpage.
      * Comments are enclosed in the <!– and –> tags. Anything between these tags will be ignored by the browser, so comments will not be visible on the webpage.
      * However, it can be useful for documenting the code or for making temporary changes. 
         For example, you could use a comment to explain why you are using a particular piece of code or to remind yourself to come back and make a change later.
